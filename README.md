#Acquisitions Inc.
Welcome to Acquisitions Inc. This is a simple web app for reviewing just about everything you can... acquire.
##Reviews
We begin on the /all-reviews page. The top of the page is a form for adding a review.
Reviews Include a title, a category, an Image URL, the actual content of the review, and a series of Tags.
Below the form you can see an un-organized list of all reviews.
##Categories
Each review has a single category, you can either add the category in the review form or from the /all-categories page. The /all-categories page also displays a list of all the categories. When you click on a given category it will display all the reviews in that category.
##Tags
Each review can have multiple tags. Much like categories you can either add tags in the /all-reviews form, or in a field on the /all-reviewTags page. Exactly like the category page the /all-reviewTags page displays a list of all the tags and their related reviews.
##Tech Stack
In this project we worked in a team that implemented Agile methodology and Scrum workflow. We used the Eclipse IDE for editing our Java code, and VScode for editing our HTML and CSS. For data persistence we used JPA, h2, and Hibernate.
